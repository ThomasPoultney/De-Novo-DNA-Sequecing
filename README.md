# De Novo DNA Sequecing
A library developed for my final year university project that efficiently assembles Genomes from DNA sequencing data. The library removes sequencing errors from the DNA data and then performs several layers of lossless, simplification and compression to reduce the complexity of the produced de Bruijn graph.
